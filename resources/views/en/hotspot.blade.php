              　　<p>The main lakes of Kenya’s Great Rift Valley include Lake Nakuru, Lake Naivasha, Lake Magadi  and Lake Victoria. The area is a birdwatcher’s paradise with clouds of brilliant pink flamingos  and a plethora of other bird species.

Lake Nakuru National Park is a fenced area, which provides a sanctuary to one of the largest  populations of rhinos in Kenya, as well as Rothschild’s giraffes, leopards and lions. The alkaline  lake often attracts flamingos, pelicans, cormorants and terns.

Over 240 species of birds have been recorded in and around the freshwater lake of Lake Naivasha. The best time for bird watching is from October to March when the migrant birds from Europe inhabit the area.</p>

              <h4>[KENYA - SAMBURU, SHABA AND MERU]</h4>
              　　<p>Samburu National Park is one of the lesser-known parks, but is nevertheless teeming with

wildlife. It’s unusual in that the landscape is a mixture of dry desert, and lush forests and

savannahs where the Ewaso Nyiro River carves its way through the region. The pockets of lush

savannahs are the perfect place for game viewing, where there is no shortage of sightings of the

big 3 cats – lions, cheetahs and leopards.

Meru National Park was made famous by the conservationists George and Joy Adamson, and the

film based on their book, ‘Born Free’. The park is extremely scenic, with many rivers that support

the wildlife.

Shaba is an exceptionally picturesque national park that was made famous by the late Joy

Adamson and her lioness Elsa. The area is home to a whole host of animals including rare

species such as Grevy’s zebra, Beisa oryx and the gerenuk.</p>
